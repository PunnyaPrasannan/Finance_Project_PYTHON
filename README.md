# Finance Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of bank stocks from before, during, and after the 2008-2009 financial crisis, up to early 2016. The aim is to practice visualization skills and proficiency with Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, numpy, cufflinks, plotly, pandas_datareader, and seaborn.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to analyze the performance of various bank stocks over a period of time, particularly focusing on the impacts of the 2008 financial crisis. This involves:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Using `pandas_datareader` to fetch stock data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Calculating returns and visualizing trends.
   - Examining correlations between different bank stocks.
   - Investigating the performance of stocks during key financial events, especially the 2008-2009 crash.
3. **Visualization**: Leveraging libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, cufflinks, and plotly to create insightful visualizations that depict the trends, correlations, and anomalies in the stock data.

## Libraries Used

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **matplotlib**: For basic plotting.
- **seaborn**: For advanced visualizations.
- **plotly** and **cufflinks**: For interactive plotting.
- **pandas_datareader**: To fetch financial data from online sources.

## Key Visualizations

- Stock price trends over time
- Returns distributions and comparisons
- Heatmaps and pairplots to show correlations
- Stock performance during specific events (e.g., 2008-2009 financial crisis)
